# Time Series Forecasting using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on time series forecasting using machine learning techniques to predict future trends based on historical data. The model leverages statistical and deep learning approaches to analyze time-dependent patterns and make accurate forecasts.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends, seasonality, and stationarity analysis.
- **Time Series Models:** Implementing ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet models for forecasting.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters to enhance accuracy.
- **Future Trend Predictions:** Forecasting short-term and long-term trends with confidence intervals.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**  
  - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
  - Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras  
  - Statsmodels, Facebook Prophet  

### Models Implemented
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)**
- **Facebook Prophet**

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of **time-stamped data** with multiple variables affecting the target prediction.
- **Sources:** Public datasets (Kaggle, UCI), financial data, weather data, or custom-generated synthetic data.
- **Data Preprocessing Includes:**  
  - Scaling, normalization, and differencing to make the time series stationary.

## Future Enhancements
- **Hybrid Models:** Combining traditional statistical models with deep learning approaches.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Implementing RL-based forecasting for adaptive predictions.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Deploying the forecasting model as an API using Flask or FastAPI.
- **Real-time Predictions:** Integrating with streaming data pipelines using Apache Kafka or AWS Lambda.
